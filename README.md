# 🫁 Asthma Classification using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Asthma Classification** project aims to build a **machine learning model** that predicts whether a person is likely to have **Asthma** or **No Asthma** based on medical records and health-related features.  

By analyzing **patient data**, the system classifies individuals into two categories:  
- ✅ **Asthma**  
- ❌ **No Asthma**  

This helps in **early diagnosis** and assists healthcare providers in making better treatment decisions.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- ✅ Predict **Asthma presence** based on health-related data  
- ✅ Assist doctors in **early detection & diagnosis**  
- ✅ Improve patient care through **data-driven insights**  
- ✅ Provide a foundation for **medical decision support systems**

## 📊 Methodology  
1. **Data Collection** – Medical datasets containing patient health records  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, normalization, encoding categorical features  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Identifying key attributes (age, lifestyle, medical history, symptoms)  
4. **Model Training** – Using supervised ML algorithms  
5. **Evaluation** – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix  
6. **Prediction** – Classify as **Asthma** or **No Asthma**
