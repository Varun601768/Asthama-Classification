A group of people who collaborate is called an organization; examples include corporations, unions, charities, and neighborhood associations. The term "organization" can be used to describe a company, group, or the process of creating something. The methodical placement of human resources inside an organization to accomplish shared commercial goals is known as organizational structure (OS). It describes each employee's duties and obligations to ensure that information and work flow freely and that the organization runs smoothly.

\section{Functional Requirements}
Functional requirements provide the core capabilities and operations of the system and specify how it should react to various inputs or conditions. These criteria serve as the foundation for the system's design, development, and testing phases.\\
The following are the functional requirements:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Collection and Preprocessing} \\
The system must make it easier to collect datasets from multiple sources in order to guarantee diversity and relevance to the problem domain. Additionally, it must preprocess the data, which include cleaning to remove abnormalities, normalizing numbers for uniformity, and correcting any missing or incomplete information. The correctness and suitability of the data for further processing are ensured by these methods.
    
    \item \textbf{Model Training} \\
The system should facilitate machine learning model training by utilizing suitable algorithms tailored to the project's requirements. Support must also be provided for hyperparameter tweaking, an essential process for optimizing the model's performance by changing key parameters to achieve the best results.

    \item \textbf{Prediction and Decision-Making} \\
The system must use the trained models to process new incoming data in order to generate accurate predictions. These projections, which provide useful information to stakeholders or system users, should serve as the foundation for decision-making processes.

    \item \textbf{User Interface} \\
The system's user-friendly interface should allow users to interact with the application effectively. This interface must allow users to easily enter data and view outputs utilizing detailed charts, graphs, or other analytics tools in order to increase user engagement and comprehension overall.

   \item \textbf{Real-Time Processing} \\
For circumstances requiring prompt responses, the system must handle real-time data streams. When new data is added, this ensures that the system remains responsive and current, providing users with immediate outputs or updates.

   \item \textbf{Error Handling} \\
The system should be robust in discovering and controlling mistakes or anomalies during data processing or prediction. To preserve system dependability and user confidence, clear error reporting and mitigation techniques are crucial.

   \item \textbf{Scalability and Integration} \\
To accommodate growing functionality or growing datasets without noticeably degrading performance, the system needs to be scalable. It should also seamlessly integrate with external APIs, tools, or platforms to increase its operational reach and flexibility.
\end{itemize}
When taken as a whole, these functional requirements ensure that the system can successfully manage project objectives, deliver consistent performance, and meet user expectations.

\section{Non Functional Requirements}
Rather than defining a system's capabilities, non-functional requirements specify how it should operate. They typically deal with the system's quality attributes, ensuring that it meets performance, reliability, and user satisfaction standards. The general characteristics that affect system scalability and user experience are the focus of these requirements.\\
The following are the functional requirements:\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Performance} \\
 The system must be able to process predictions, model training, and data input rapidly. It should be able to handle large datasets efficiently and generate predictions or insights in a timely manner. A fast response time is crucial for user satisfaction, especially in real-time applications.
    
    \item \textbf{Scalability} \\
Machine learning models should be easy to train with the system's suitable algorithms tailored to the project's requirements. The process of hyperparameter tuning, which is essential for optimizing the model's performance by changing significant parameters to achieve the best results, must also be enabled.

    \item \textbf{Reliability} \\
The system must use the trained models to process new incoming data in order to generate accurate predictions. These projections, which provide useful information to stakeholders or system users, should serve as the foundation for decision-making processes.
    \item \textbf{Usability} \\
The system's user-friendly interface should allow users to interact with the program effectively; to enhance user engagement and comprehension in general, the interface should allow users to easily enter data and view outputs using detailed charts, graphs, or other analytics tools.

   \item \textbf{Security} \\
The system must protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. Secure authentication methods and encryption should be used to safeguard the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data.

   \item \textbf{Maintainability} \\
The system should be easy to maintain and update. It must be built with easily readable, modular code that can be easily altered to add new features or fix issues as they arise. Regular system upgrades and patches should be simple to apply.

   \item \textbf{Availability} \\
The system should be accessible and available with minimal downtime. Especially if real-time apps are being used, it must be able to run continuously so that users can use the system whenever they choose.

  \item \textbf{Compatibility} \\
The system must be compatible with a range of browsers and devices in order to allow for broad accessibility. For users to interact with it in a range of contexts, it should be interoperable with several platforms and operating systems.
\end{itemize}
These non-functional requirements ensure that the system not only performs its intended functions but also meets stringent quality, user experience, and operational efficiency requirements.

\section{Software Requirements}
Software requirements are the basic instruments, frameworks, and technologies that were used to build the project. These requirements ensure that the system is built efficiently and has the resources required to achieve its objectives. The foundation for an effective project's development, implementation, and maintenance is a well-defined set of software requirements.

TensorFlow was used in combination with Keras, a high-level API for creating neural networks, to streamline the model-building procedure. Its intuitive interface made it possible to quickly design and experiment with different architectures.

    \item \textbf{Pandas} \\
Datasets were handled and cleaned using Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library, to guarantee that the data fed into machine learning models was suitably preprocessed.

    \item \textbf{NumPy} \\
NumPy made numerical calculations easier, particularly when handling large arrays and matrices, which are crucial for machine learning model training.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{
User Interface Design }
The system's user interface (UI) was designed with responsiveness, usability, and simplicity in mind to give users the greatest possible experience across a variety of devices. The frontend was primarily created using HTML, CSS, and the Flask web framework.
